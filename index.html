        <h1><strong>How to play the game</strong></h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          The rooms int maze are symbolized by a 7x7 square grid cells. For each
          room we know that which wall has a door. If there are two doors in the
          contact wall of two neighbouring rooms, you can go from one room to
          another. The even rows and columns in the grid can be slided, the
          other rooms are fixed throughout the game. By sliding the rooms in the
          grid, doors and passages open through which players can move in the
          maze. By cleverly sliding the rooms players try to find their way to
          the treasures. The first player to find all their treasures and return
          to the starting square is the winner.<br />
          <strong> At the beginning of the game</strong> we put the rooms in
          random order and in random direction to the free fields of the game
          board. There should be one room remaining. During the game we will
          always use the extra room to slide the rest of the rooms. In the game
          you have to find up to 24 treasures. These are randomly placed on the
          board so that only one treasure can be in a room and can not be placed
          in the corner. For each treasure there is a card. We shuffle these
          treasure cards and divide them evenly among the players and revealing
          the top card. Playing pieces are placed in separate corners of the
          board.
          <br />
          <strong> During the game</strong> each player has to find his/her
          revealed treasure card (that can be seen by others). The player tries
          to get to the room showing the same treasure as on this card. For this
          the player needs to

          <br />move the maze, and after that<br />
          move the playing piece.<br />
          Moving the maze is done as follows: the player inserts the extra room
          into the game board where one of the arrows shows the slidable rows
          and columns, until another room is pushed out of the maze on the
          opposite side. The only exception: The room cannot be inserted back
          into the board at the same place where it was pushed out. So you
          cannot undo the previous player's move. If the room you push out has a
          playing piece on it, put this piece on the opposite side of the board
          on the room that was just placed. The treasures always move with the
          rooms. Once you have moved the maze, you can move your playing piece.
          You can occupy any square that you can move your piece to directly,
          without interruption. You can move your playing piece as far as you
          like. Or, you can leave your playing piece where it is. There can be
          more than one playing piece in one room: playing pieces do not hit
          each other. If you are unable to get to the treasure you are searching
          for, you can move your playing piece into a position that gives you a
          good starting point for your next turn. Once you find the treasure you
          are looking for, reveal your next treasure card. On your next turn,
          find your way to this treasure on the game board. Now it’s the next
          player’s turn. This player inserts the extra room into the game board
          before moving their playing piece, and so on. The game is over as soon
          as a player has found all their treasure cards and returned their
          playing piece to its starting position. The first player to do this is
          the winner.
